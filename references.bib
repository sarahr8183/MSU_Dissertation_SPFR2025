  Abstract                 = {Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS) is now widely used for the control and conversion of electric power from one watt to several megawatts. In this context, the synthesis and use of wide bandgap semiconductor materials having physical characteristics superior to silicon is essential. Due to its outstanding physical properties (thermal conductivity, breakdown voltage, carrier mobilitiesâ€¦), diamond is a very promising material. However the success of its use in power electronics mostly relies on our ability to provide carriers by doping the material in a controlled manner. In particular the growth of thick heavily boron doped material is an essential requirement to develop vertical components which should allow, as it will be shown by modeling, limiting the series resistance of the devices in their on-state. Deposition conditions required to obtain high growth rate, high quality and heavily boron-doped material by plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition (MPACVD) will be described. It will be shown in particular that high growth rate, high-quality material, which is obtained at high microwave power density, comes at the expense of the boron concentration, and a compromise must be found. Preliminary results on boron doping of single crystal diamond will be presented and associated with electrical properties of pseudo-vertical Schottky Barrier Diodes (SBD). In particular, a critical electric field of 1.3&#xa0;MV/cm has been demonstrated with a rectifying ratio of 109. In the same time, current density close to 1500â€“2000&#xa0;A&#xa0;cmâˆ’&#xa0;2 has been reached, showing the potentiality of diamond for power-electronic applications. },

  Abstract                 = {A C H O phase diagram is introduced providing a common scheme for all major diamond chemical vapour deposition (CVD) methods used to date. It reveals that low pressure diamond synthesis is only feasible within a well-defined field of the phase diagram, a diamond domain that allows general predictions of gas phase compositions and starting materials suitable for diamond synthesis. It gives an explanation for the quality variations of diamonds deposited from different gas mixtures. The concept originates from the thorough analysis of experiments by thermal CVD, hot filament CVD, various plasma deposition techniques and combustion flames. This analysis also shows that the large deposition rate differences between the various methods correlate well with the coirresponding gas temperatures, indicating that a hot spot in the gas phase fosters high rate diamond growth.},

  Abstract                 = {High rate homoepitaxial diamond growth by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) was studied. At a gas pressure of 200 mbar and a methane concentration of 10% a maximum growth rate of 30 Î¼m/h was obtained. High pyramidal hillocks with pronounced step bunching on the side faces develop during growth on (001) oriented Ib substrate crystals. The peak of the pyramids is formed by non-epitaxial particles. Using (001) oriented crystals with a vicinal angle greater than the typical inclination angle of the pyramids' side faces is an efficient strategy to suppress the non-epitaxial crystals completely. The characteristic morphological changes on the surface can be explained by the dynamics of nucleation of new lattice planes and their consumption. Homoepitaxial layers with a thickness of up to 1.3 mm were successfully grown in this way. After removal of the nitrogen containing Ib substrate one sample showed a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.0043Â° in high resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) measurements. Most of them were in the range between 0.01Â° and 0.03Â°. In Raman spectra, the measured diamond line was extraordinarily narrow with a typical \{FWHM\} of about 1.63 cmâˆ’1. In addition, the low luminescence background in photoluminescence (PL) spectra excited with the 488 nm line of an Ar+ ion laser proved the excellent quality of the samples. },

  Abstract                 = {Infrared, ultraviolet and cathodoluminescence measurements have been made on five synthetic diamonds which were grown using the temperature-gradient technique. The samples, which were a few millimeters in size, were chosen by virtue of having relatively well-developed {110} and {113} minor facets as well as {100} and {111} major faces. The samples, labelled Iâ€“V, were prepared in the form of polished plates. Sample I was a standard type Ib synthetic diamond. Infrared and ultraviolet absorption measurements were used to determine the concentration of isolated substitutional nitrogen present in the various types of growth sector. The {111} sectors contained about 100 ppm of nitrogen; the {100} sectors contained slightly less than 50 ppm; the {113} sectors contained of the order of 10 ppm and the {110} sectors contained approximately 1 ppm. For the remaining samples, IIâ€“V, the concentration of nitrogen incorporated during growth was greatly reduced by the introduction of nitrogen getters into the synthesis capsule. Even so, concentrations of a few ppm of nitrogen could generally be detected in {111} sectors. Sample \{II\} contained a concentration of 0.27 ppm of neutral boron acceptors in the (11Â¯0) sector despite the fact that boron had not been deliberately introduced during synthesis. The remaining three samples were deliberately doped with boron, the amount being less for sample \{III\} than for the samples \{IV\} and V. For sample III, the uncompensated acceptor concentration was highest in the {110} sectors, being approximately 3 ppm, approximately 0.9 ppm in the {113} sectors, 0.5 ppm in the {100} sectors and too small to be measured in the {111} sectors. For the highly-doped samples, \{IV\} and V, however, the uncompensated boron concentration was highest for the {111} sectors. Acceptor-centre zero-phonon lines are broadened out in {111} sectors, presumably as a result of higher defect concentrations in these sectors. Cathodoluminescence measurements at a temperature of approximately 90 K have revealed a new vibronic system with a zero-phonon line at 2.296 eV (539.9 nm). This system was observed only in the (11Â¯0) sector of sample I and in non-octahedral sectors of the other samples. The 2.56 eV (484 nm) cathodoluminescence system was present with high intensity in all {111} sectors of sample I but only in one {111} sector of sample II. It was absent from sample \{III\} and weak in sample IV. All samples exhibited spectrally-broad cathodoluminescence which consisted, in general, of two components, a blue band with a peak at 420 nm and a broader green band with a peak occuring between 490 and 540 nm. },

  Abstract                 = {C. D. Clark, R. W. Ditchburn and H. B. DyerAbstract
The absorption spectra of fifty-two natural diamonds have been measured at 80 and 290 degrees K. Type I diamonds are shown to have two kinds of absorption centres which are not detected in type II diamonds. Differences in the infra-red absorption spectra between type IIa and type IIb diamonds are reported. The classification of diamonds is discussed. The absorption produced by irradiating diamonds with electrons, neutrons and $\gamma $-rays is described. The general nature of the changes produced by the different forms of radiation is the same, but significant differences in the breadths and wavelengths of the induced absorption lines have been observed. Electron-irradiated type IIa diamonds show absorption lines not observed in irradiated type I diamonds. There is a similarity between the sets of natural absorption lines in type I diamonds and those produced by irradiation. A model relating the induced absorption to interstitial carbon atoms, vacant atomic sites and regions of amorphous or graphitic carbon is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {A precision study has been made of the temperature dependence of the Hall effect and resistivity in five carefully selected natural semiconducting diamonds. The donor and acceptor concentrations in each sample have been calculated from the Hall effect data, and the acceptor concentrations are shown to correlate excellently with the intensities of the acceptor infrared absorption spectrum in each diamond. The behaviour of the resistivity is characteristic of a single acceptor centre, and the much lower activation energy observed at low temperatures is attributed to the tunnelling of electrons from ionized to neutral acceptor centres. The aluminium concentration in each crystal has been measured by slow neutron activation analysis and found to be substantially lower than the acceptor concentration in every case. Aluminium therefore cannot form the acceptor centre as was previously thought. Boron is the only group III element that neutron activation analysis has not eliminated as a possible acceptor, and the results of other workers point to boron as a likely candidate. The revised interpretation, that the acceptor centre in semiconducting diamond is definitely not aluminium and probably boron, is discussed, and its significance to previous publications is critically considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Synopsis In the course of a research program on type I and type \{II\} diamonds, a stone was found which showed a phosphorescence which is unusual for diamonds, or at least fairly rare. Although this precious diamond was available for so short a time that not many observations could be made, it was felt worth while to set these down in the form of a paper. This phosphorescence is excited by short-wave ultra-violet light and it is quenched very rapidly by long-wave ultra-violet. A spectrum of the phosphorescence has been taken which shows maxima at 4665, 5310 and 5720 A.U. respectively. It is suggested that there might exist two different types of type \{II\} diamond which is the type transparent in the far ultra-violet. Type \{IIb\} will phosphoresce when excited by far ultra-violet radiation and it will show high electrical conductivity whereas type \{IIa\} will not phosphoresce in the far ultra-violet neither will it show high conductivity.},

The deposition of monocrystalline diamond at or below 1 atm at T<1273 K has been achieved on diamond substrates; the film is polycrystalline on all other substrates, but the achievement is no less significant. Recent SiC research has culminated in a host of solid-state devices. It is noted that the recent developments in thin-film deposition and bulk growth techniques coupled with the positive results from doping, oxidation, and ohmic and rectifying contact studies for alpha (6H)-SiC have catalyzed a growing, international effort to develop microelectronic devices from this material for high-temperature, -power, and -frequency applications and radiation hardness. To this end, operable p-n junctions, Schottky diodes, MESFETs, MOSFETs, and HBTs have been produced with encouraging characteristics.<>},

  Abstract                 = {Diamond offers tremendous potential for electronic applications such as field effect transistors. An investigation of the electrical properties of boron-doped homoepitaxial diamond films and the metal-oxide-diamond gate structure was performed. Additionally, field effect transistors were fabricated and characterized. Improvements in the diamond deposition process produced boron-doped homoepitaxial diamond films where the room temperature Hall mobility exceeded 1000 cm2 Vâˆ’1 sâˆ’1. Analysis of the temperature-dependent carrier concentration indicated that the compensation was &lt; 3 Ã— 1015cmâˆ’3. The gate structure for metal-silicon dioxide-boron-doped diamond field effect transistors was evaluated by current-voltage and capacitance voltage measurements. Good correlation of the uncompensated acceptor concentration, determined by capacitance-voltage measurements, and the boron concentration, determined by secondary ion mass spectroscopy, was attained. Preliminary measurements suggested that the density of interface states for this structure was â‰ˆ 1012 cmâˆ’2 eVâˆ’1. Field effect transistors exhibited saturation and pinch-off at temperatures as high as 773 K. The highest normalized transconductance measured was 1.3 mS mmâˆ’1. The field effect transistors were combined into analogue and digital circuits that operated at 523 K and 673 K, respectively. },

  Abstract                 = {In order to improve the performance of existing technologies based on single crystal diamond grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and to open up new technologies in fields such as quantum computing or solid state and semiconductor disc lasers, control over surface and bulk crystalline quality is of great importance. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching using an Ar/Cl gas mixture is demonstrated to remove sub-surface damage of mechanically processed surfaces, whilst maintaining macroscopic planarity and low roughness on a microscopic scale. Dislocations in high quality single crystal \{CVD\} diamond are shown to be reduced by using substrates with a combination of low surface damage and low densities of extended defects. Substrates engineered such that only a minority of defects intersect the epitaxial surface are also shown to lead to a reduction in dislocation density. Anisotropy in the birefringence of single crystal \{CVD\} diamond due to the preferential direction of dislocation propagation is reported. Ultra low birefringence plates (&lt;&#xa0;10âˆ’&#xa0;5) are now available for intra-cavity heat spreaders in solid state disc lasers, and the application is no longer limited by depolarisation losses. Birefringence of less than 5&#xa0;Ã—&#xa0;10âˆ’&#xa0;7 along a direction perpendicular to the \{CVD\} growth direction has been demonstrated in exceptionally high quality samples. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the evolution of the infra-red absorption of high-quality epitaxial diamond films versus boron concentration is reported. Homoepitaxial diamond films were grown by microwave-plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition on type Ib crystals. From 2Ã—1017 to 8Ã—1020&#xa0;cmâˆ’3 of boron were incorporated in the diamond from the gas phase during growth. The main absorption features are (1) a single phonon absorption around 160&#xa0;meV, (2) a series of three lines at 304, 347 and 363&#xa0;meV due to excited states of the bound hole, (3) a photoionisation continuum, and (4) a phonon replica of these electronic transitions. The evolution of these absorption with the boron concentration is presented and discussed. A strong increase in the photoionisation cross-section for boron concentrations above 5Ã—1018&#xa0;cmâˆ’3 is observed. New linear relationships between the boron concentration and the integrated absorption at 347&#xa0;meV and the photoionisation are proposed. From the evolution of the lines due to transitions to boron-excited states, we deduced the width of the impurity band versus the boron concentration.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Semiconducting n-type diamond can be fabricated using phosphorus as a substitutional donor dopant. The dopant activation energy level at 0.58&#xa0;eV is deep. At high dopant concentrations of 1020&#xa0;cmâˆ’&#xa0;3 the activation energy reduces to less than 0.05&#xa0;eV. Phosphorus doping at concentrations of 1020&#xa0;cmâˆ’&#xa0;3 or higher has been achieved with epitaxial growth on the (111) diamond crystallographic surface. In this work epitaxial growth of diamond with high phosphorus concentrations exceeding 1020&#xa0;cmâˆ’&#xa0;3 is performed using a microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition process with process conditions that include a pressure of 160&#xa0;Torr. This pressure is higher than previous phosphorus doping reports of (111) surface diamond growth. The other growth conditions include a feedgas mixture of 0.25% methane and 500&#xa0;ppm phosphine in hydrogen, and a substrate temperature of 950â€“1000&#xa0;Â°C. The measured growth rate was 1.25&#xa0;Î¼m/h. The room temperature resistivity of the heavily phosphorus doped diamond was 120â€“150&#xa0;Î©-cm and the activation energy was 0.027&#xa0;eV. },

Growth hillocks leading to rough surfaces were almost perfectly suppressed under the new growth processes, where the substrate temperature was set to a particular region. The high quality in electronic states was evidenced by the fact that the homoepitaxial films with thicknesses up to 11 Âµm gave intense free-exciton recombination emissions in room-temperature cathodoluminescence spectra. It is concluded that lobe-shape marks appearing on the surface after an apparent lateral diamond growth came from defects left on the substrate surface. The origin of the apparent lateral growth observed is discussed in relation to an enhanced speed of the step edge growth at the substrate temperature elevated to âˆ¼1000Â°C.},

  Abstract                 = {Cathodoluminescence at 5 K is used to study the residual radiative defects in homoepitaxial diamond films deposited on the centre of the plasma ball versus the O/CH4 ratio from 0 to 0.375 in the feeding gas, and to understand their effect on the quality (intensity of the free exciton peaks) of the films. The addition of oxygen significantly reduces the slight boron contamination (1.6Ã—1016 to 4Ã—1014 cmâˆ’3) of these good quality (BENP exciton peak) non-intentionally doped films. As the O/C ratio increases, (i) the intensities of the boron-bound excitons, Ncâ€“Vc, H3, Ncâ€“Ic peaks, of the 2.3 eV wide band and the nitrogen contamination decrease (ii) the intensity of the \{N3\} peak and the relative intensity of the A band increase. These opposite variations of the defects concentration as O/C increases result in a maximum of the \{FE\} peaks for O/C around 0.25. },

The currentâ€“temperature characteristics from 300 to 1000&#xa0;K have been measured and fitted by the general expression of the conductivity in a compensated semiconductor in the ionisation regime. The saturation of the conductivity is observed between 680 and 1000&#xa0;K for the samples doped below 2Ã—1017&#xa0;cmâˆ’3. In the range 1018â€“1019&#xa0;cmâˆ’3, an activation energy of 185&#xa0;meV is observed between 500 and 1000&#xa0;K and around 368&#xa0;meV between 300 and 500&#xa0;K. The activation energy of 185&#xa0;meV corresponds to half the boron ionisation energy, and is related to the conduction regime in an uncompensated semiconductor. The evolution of these activation energies and of the room-temperature resistivity with the boron doping are presented. },

  Abstract                 = {Cubo-octahedral diamond crystals were formed by microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition of methane and hydrogen on a Si(100) wafer. Trimethylboron was then added to the gas phase as the boron source, and diamond was homoepitaxially deposited on the {100} and {111} of the seed crystals. The growth rate, which was determined from geometrical changes in the crystals, was affected by the type of diamond faces, as well as the boron to carbon (BC) ratio in the gas phase. The rate decreased with increasing the \{BC\} ratio at concentrations below 400 ppm, and was independent of the \{BC\} ratio at concentrations in excess of 500 ppm. Furthermore, boron-doped diamond films were formed on single-crystalline (100) and (111) diamond substrates by varying the \{BC\} ratio in the gas phase, and depth profiles of boron and hydrogen were determined by secondary ion mass spectroscopy. The boron content in the (100) and (111) diamond increased with increasing \{BC\} ratio in the gas phase and was 9 Ã— 1017cmâˆ’3 and 1 Ã— 1019cmâˆ’3, respectively, when the \{BC\} ratio in the gas phase was 2000 ppm. },

Seebeck effect measurement and the temperature dependence of the resistance revealed an appearance of deep acceptor levels in the hydrogenated diamond layer. The diffusion depth of the hydrogen by the plasma treatment (2 h, 830Â°C) was roughly estimated to be âˆ¼0.6 Âµm from the drain current-voltage characteristics of a rudimentary MISFET using the hydrogenated diamond.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple one-dimensional Monte Carlo model has been developed to simulate the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of a diamond (100) surface. The model considers adsorption, etching/desorption, lattice incorporation, and surface migration along and across the dimer rows. The top of a step-edge is considered to have an infinite Ehrlichâ€“Schwoebel potential barrier, so that mobile surface species cannot migrate off the edge. The reaction probabilities are taken from experimental or calculated literature values for standard CVD diamond conditions. The criterion used for the critical nucleus needed to form a new layer is considered to be two surface carbon species bonded together, which forms an immobile, unetchable step on the surface. This nucleus can arise from two migrating species meeting, or from direct adsorption of a carbon species next to a migrating species. The analysis includes film growth rate, surface roughness, and the evolving film morphology as a function of varying reaction probabilities. Using standard CVD diamond parameters, the simulations reveal that a smooth film is produced with apparent step-edge growth, with growth rates (~1Â ÂµmÂ h âˆ’1 ) consistent with experiment. The Î²-scission reaction was incorporated into the model, but was found to have very little effect upon growth rates or film morphology. Renucleation events believed to be due to reactive adsorbates, such as C atoms or CN groups, were modelled by creating random surface defects which form another type of critical nucleus upon which to nucleate a new layer. These were found to increase the growth rate by a factor of ~10 when the conditions were such that the rate-limiting step for growth was new layer formation. For other conditions these surface defects led to layered 'wedding cake' structures or to rough irregular surfaces resembling those seen experimentally during CVD of nanocrystalline diamond.},

A three-stage treatment is applied after homoepitaxial \{CVD\} growth. First the original substrate is separated by laser cutting, then the cut surface is mechanically polished, and finally polycrystalline material at the edges of the recovered seed plate is laser trimmed. This recovery process yields reusable diamond substrates that do not differ appreciably from their original state in terms of stresses and impurity concentrations. While the recovery process was demonstrated using \{HPHT\} seed substrates the process can also be applied to the as-grown \{CVD\} diamond plates. Infrared absorption spectral analysis, surface profilometry, birefringence imaging and Raman spectroscopy are performed after each processing step to monitor crystal quality. The nitrogen concentration in the substrate crystal remains constant throughout \{CVD\} and recovery processes. When using \{HPHT\} type Ib substrates the detected nitrogen concentration is 110â€“180&#xa0;ppm. The nitrogen is mainly incorporated in form of C center defects and no transformation to other forms of defect centers occurs during the \{CVD\} process. Birefringence imaging showed a low level of internal stress within the \{HPHT\} crystals. No change is observed during \{CVD\} growth and recovery processes. It is shown that the polycrystalline rim removal is essential for repeatable \{CVD\} deposition on the same seed substrate. Substrate crystal recovery allows growth of up to 20 crystals from one original seed. },

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the boron (B) incorporation ratio ((B/C)film) in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) homoepitaxial diamond films as a parameter of the misorientation-angle (Î¸off) of substrates under the partial step-flow condition of (CH4/H2)gas=0.3%. The boron concentration in a diamond network, NB, strongly depends on Î¸off. This suggests that there are two processes for incorporation of boron atoms in a diamond network: one is caused by step-flow growth and the other is caused by island growth on a terrace of a growing diamond surface. Using a simplified model focusing on the step-flow growth in which a boron atom embedded in the top layer is desorbed from the surface with a certain probability, we analyzed the mechanism by which boron is incorporated into diamond \{CVD\} films.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The empirical know-how of single crystalline diamond polishing has been developed over centuries in the diamond gem cutting industry. Since the 1950s new and varied uses and potential applications for synthetically produced diamond have been consistently proposed and developed. This innovation process continues with the availability of ever better, more specialized and less costly single crystalline and polycrystalline diamond materials. Yet, the potential exploitation of this hardest of materials is still in its infancy. Polishing is a critical and limiting step for advancing diamond applications in terms of cost effective processing and the achievable material surface finish. The current state-of-the-art of polishing single crystalline and polycrystalline diamond materials is reviewed based on the published literature. The material removal process during traditional mechanical polishing using diamond grit and polishing wheels is strongly anisotropic and depends upon crystal planes and polishing directions. Wear debris analyses and molecular dynamic simulations led to the understanding that this anisotropy is primarily caused by a mechanically induced transition from diamond to an amorphous carbon phase rather than by microchipping as previously thought. Mechanical polishing also leads to subsurface damage and limits the achievable surface finish for single crystalline diamond. Advanced techniques are discussed to improve the polished crystal's surface quality. Mechanical polishing of polycrystalline diamond films and freestanding plates is particularly slow due to the intrinsic structure variations in such materials. To overcome these limitations faster polishing techniques have been developed and are reviewed and compared. These techniques introduce additional chemical and physical means of material removal extending the capabilities of mechanical polishing. There is no single method that can address all requirements, but the available variety affords the careful selection of an optimal process for a given task. Finally, while diamond polishing is a subject of interest since centuries, it still remains a very important research area required to unfold the promise of diamond as a technical material. },

  Abstract                 = {The infra-red absorption spectrum of two natural Type IIb semi-conducting diamonds has been measured by high resolution grating spectroscopy in the range 0.1 to 0.7 eV and at temperatures from 70Â° to 293 Â°K. The various absorption features (observed in much greater detail at low temperature than hitherto) were as follows: (i) a series of three lines due to excited states of bound holes at 0.305, 0.347 and 0.363 eV together with many smaller peaks, (ii) secondary peaks at 0.462, 0.508, 0.625 and 0.670 eV in the continuum and (iii) a low-level absorption near 0.16 eV. The observed widths of the excited states are inconsistent with the broadening theory of Lax and Burstein. However Kane's recent theory of lifetime broadening predicts the observed width of the 0.305 eV line to the correct order of magnitude. Hardy has shown that both ( a ) optical-phonon-assisted transitions and ( b ) impurity-induced single-phonon absorption are likely to occur in diamond. These conclusions are confirmed by ( a ) the observation of peaks in the continuum at energies separated from the excited states by 0.159 eV, the TO phonon energy and ( b ) the presence of absorption just below the Raman energy at 0.165 eV. The cross section for this single-phonon absorption is much higher than for the Type I (nitrogen) or irradiation-induced lattice absorption.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Schottky interface properties of p-diamond (100) were investigated. Gold (Au), which is a representative noble metal, and tungsten carbide (WC), a carbide preformed metal, were selected as Schottky contact metals. When Au was used as the Schottky metal, Schottky properties were strongly related to the surface oxidation method. The Schottky barrier height was as high as &gt;&#xa0;2&#xa0;eV. The distribution of the ideality factor became small when using the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light/ozone treatment for diamond surface oxidation, compared to the case of conventional wet-chemical oxidation treatment. However, for a \{WC\} Schottky contact, interface properties were insensitive to the surface oxidation method. This insensitivity was regarded as deriving from the formation of interfacial bonding between \{WC\} and diamond during metal deposition. Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) prepared by the \{VUV\} light/ozone treatment showed good temperature stability with low reverse current of &lt;&#xa0;1&#xa0;pA up to 550&#xa0;K. Through heating at higher temperatures of &gt;&#xa0;600&#xa0;K, the ideality factor of Au \{SBD\} increased and the Schottky barrier height changed greatly. Oxygen termination dissociation was inferred to occur at the Au/diamond Schottky interface. \{WC\} \{SBD\} had better thermal stability than Au \{SBD\} because the interface was stabilized by interfacial bonding. },

The VSBD was mounted on a metal-ceramic package with a gold bonding wire and a high-temperature resistive resin. The switching behavior of the packaged diamond VSBD was characterized by a double-pulse method at elevated temperatures.

Even under a low electrical field, 50% of the fabricated diamond \{SBDs\} exhibited a high leakage current that cannot be explained by any of the carrier transport mechanisms through the Schottky barrier. The \{SBDs\} with high leakage current were confirmed to contain a high density of dislocations that are revealed as deep etch pits by H2/CO2 plasma treatment. The maximum operation voltage of the \{SBDs\} is clearly dependent on the number of deep etch pits. },

A small amount of diborane improves the crystal quality of deposited diamond with changing the Raman spectral features. The asymmetry and broadening of the one-phonon are due to Fano interference, and broad bands centered ca 500 and 1230&#xa0;cmâˆ’1 appear. },

  Abstract                 = {Epitaxial, boron-doped diamond films were grown by hot-filament-assisted chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on (100) and (110) natural diamond substrates. Resistivity measurements for 10 K<T<500 K showed a clear transition from band to hopping conduction upon lowering of temperature. In the band conduction regime, the (100) films had higher conductivity than the (110) samples. The reverse was found in the hopping regime. This is explained by the difference in crystal growth mechanisms, leading to higher boron concentrations and lower carrier mobilities for (110) samples than for (100) oriented films. Hall effect measurements were performed for the most lightly doped (100) film at a boron level of 2.7*10 18 cm -3 in the band conduction region up to 750 K. A mobility maximum of mu H =590 cm 2 V -1 s -1 at 295 K was found, and the compensation ratio was determined to be smaller than 0.02. Some preliminary values for the Hall effective mass of valence band holes are given.},

All the diamonds were p-type semiconductors. From the measurements the effective mass of the charge carriers, the concentration of donor and acceptor centres, the activation energy of the acceptors (close to 0.34 eV) and the temperature dependence of the Hall mobility have been calculated. At high temperatures the mobility varies as T -2.8 . The relative strengths of certain peaks in the infra-red absorption spectrum are the same in different specimens. It is concluded that all these peaks are due to the same centre. These peaks are not detected in type I and type IIa diamonds. There is a strong correlation between the strength of the strongest peak at 0.346 eV and the number of vacant acceptor levels at room temperature, from which it is concluded that the centre giving rise to the peaks is also responsible for conduction.},

  Abstract                 = {High-quality B-doped homoepitaxial diamond films have been synthesized by microwave plasma chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD) using a mixture consisting of CH 4 , H 2 , and trimethylboron B(CH 3 ) 3 diluted by H 2 gas. These films have been obtained on the basis of the approach that high-quality diamond films should be grown in a clean CVD system. Hall-effect measurements of the film show that the Hall mobility exceeds about 1800 cm 2 /VÂ·s when the hole concentration is 2.3Ã—10 14 cm -3 at room temperature (290 K) and about 3300 cm 2 /VÂ·s at 170 K. These results indicate that the quality of the present B-doped CVD films is comparable with or better than that of high-quality natural diamonds.},
