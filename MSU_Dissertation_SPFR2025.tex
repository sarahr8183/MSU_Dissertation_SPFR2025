%%%%%%%% NOTE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% PREPARING A DISSERTATION WITH THIS CLASS FILE DOES NOT %%%
%% GUARANTEE THAT THE GRADUATE SCHOOL WILL APPROVE IT %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%% WARNING %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% The Graduate School requires that all text, except superscripts %%
%% and subscripts, but including text in imported %%
%% graphics files be in 12 point. For that reason it's recommended %%
%% that no text be part of any imported files. %%

%% Once your document has been filed with the Graduate School,
%% if you wish to produce a version of it whose subscripts and superscripts
%% are in traditional smaller proportion, remove the "%" sign 
%% in front of following command. 
%\DeclareMathSizes{12}{12}{10}{8}
%% To single space your document, find and remove the 
%% two commands \begin{doublespace}
%% and \end{doublespace} below.

\begin{document}
\begin{otherlanguage}{english}
\maketitlepage %%This command will produce the title page of your thesis.
\begin{abstract}
%put your abstract here
test text
\end{abstract}

%% If you wish to have a copyright page, remove the "%" in front of \begin{copyrt}
%% and remove the "%" in front of \end{copyrt}.
%% The mandatory form of the Copyright will be generated automatically. 
%% A copyright statement is optional.

%\begin{copyrt}
%\end{copyrt}

\begin{dedication} 
%put your dedication here
This is my dedication page
\end{dedication}

%% If you wish to have an acknowledgment, remove the "%" in front of \begin{acknowledgment}
%% and remove the "%" in front of \end{acknowledgment}
\begin{acknowledgment}
%% Type your acknowledgment here. An acknowledgment is optional.
\end{acknowledgment}

%% If you wish to have a preface, remove the "%" in front of \begin{preface}
%% and remove the "%" in front of \end{preface}. The formatting of
%% a preface isn't specified.
%\begin{preface}
%% Type your preface here. A preface is optional.
%\end{preface}

\TOC %% This command produces the Table of Contents. DO NOT REMOVE!

%% If your document contains tables, remove the "%" in front of 
%% the following line.
%\LOT

%% If your document contains figures, remove the "%" in front of
%% the following line.
%\LOF

%% If any of your figures contain color, you must
%% include the following disclaimer in the caption of your first figure.
%% "For interpretation of the references to color in this and all other figures, 
%% the reader is referred to the electronic version of this thesis."

%%%% LIST OF SYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS %%%%
%% Such a list is possible using the environment
%% abbreviationskey
%% here. The list will be included in the TOC as
%% KEY TO SYMBOLS AND ABBREVIATIONS
%% To change the name something else, remove the "%" 
%% from the next line and change "Desired Name" to your choice.

%%%%%%%%%% NESTING .TEX FILES %%%%%%%%%
%Use this command in the document body to insert the contents of another file named filename.tex; again this file should not contain any LATEX preamble. LATEX will start a new page before processing the material input from filename.tex. Make sure not to include the extension .tex in the filename, as this will stop the file from being input (the extension can optionally be included with input and import). It is not possible to nest include commands. Each file that gets \included has its own .aux file storing information of created labels and contents for the table of contents, list of figures, etc. You can use \includeonly with a comma separated list of file names (make sure that there are no leading or trailing spaces). If you do this LATEX will only process the files contained in that list. This can be used to enhance compilation speed if you're only working on a small part of a bigger document. Page numbers and cross references will however still work, as the .aux files of left out files will still be processed.

%%%%%%% APPENDICES %%%%%%%%%%
%% If you wish to include one appendix, remove the "%" from the 
%% following two lines.
%\renewcommand{\appname}{APPENDIX}
%\appendix
%% To include several appendices, remove the only the "%"
%% in front of "\appendix".

%% In either cast to start your first appendix, which will be labeled
%% as Appendix A, just type \chapter{<appendix 1 name>}
%% and enter the text of the appendix as you would a chapter.

\end{doublespace}

%%%%%% Bibliography %%%%%
%% A bibliography is required. By default it is called, "Bibliography"
%% You may use �Literature Cited�, �Works Cited� or �References� 
%% instead of �Bibliography� if that is the convention in your discipline. 
%% To do so, place your choice in the empty argument 
%% of the following command and remove the "%".
\renewcommand{\bibname}{REFERENCES}


\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
\bibliography{references} %references in references.bib BibTeX file
%% The bibliography may be made using BibTeX.
%% To do so the necessary commands must be entered in the 
%% preamble and here.
%% If the Bibliography is made from scratch,
%% remove the "%" in front of "\begin{thebibliography}{???}"
%% replacing the ??? with the appropriate entry and 
%% remove the "%" in front of "\end{thebibliography}"
% \begin{thebibliography}{???}
%% Enter the bibliography here.
% \end{thebibliography}
%% In either case, the bibliography is automatically entered
%% in the Table of Contents.
