   abstract = {© 2019 Optical Society of America. Atomic defects in wide-bandgap materials, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond, show considerable promise for the development of a new generation of quantum information technologies, but progress has been hampered by the inability to produce and engineer the defects in a controlled manner. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical method for the deterministic writing of individual NV centers at selected locations with high positioning accuracy. Ultrashort pulse laser processing is used to both create and diffuse defects inside the crystal through local annealing. During the laser-annealing process, online fluorescence feedback provides a trigger to stop processing once the NV formation is detected. This method provides a new tool for the optical fabrication of engineered materials and devices for quantum technologies.},

They exhibited smooth surface morphologies and a crystalline quality comparable to (100) electronic grade material, and much better than (111)-grown layers. High growth rates (15-50 μm/h) were obtained while nitrogen doping could be achieved in a fairly wide range without seriously imparting crystalline quality. Electron spin resonance measurements were carried out to determine NV centers orientation and concluded that one specific orientation has an occurrence probability of 73% when (100)-grown layers show an equal distribution in the 4 possible directions. A spin coherence time of around 270 μs was measured which is equivalent to that reported for material with similar isotopic purity. Although a higher degree of preferential orientation was achieved with (111)-grown layers (almost 100%), the ease of growth and post-processing of the (113) orientation make it a potentially useful material for magnetometry or other quantum mechanical applications.},

   abstract = {Diamond has some of the most extreme physical properties of any material, yet its practical use in science or engineering has been limited due its scarcity and expense. With the recent development of techniques for depositing thin ­ lms of diamond on a variety of substrate materials, we now have the ability to exploit these superlative properties in many new and exciting applications. In this paper, we shall explain the basic science and technology underlying the chemical vapour deposition of diamond thin ­ lms, and show how this is leading to the development of diamond as a 21st century engineering material. 1. The diamond in history Probably more so than any other gemstone, diamonds feature more predominantly in the history and cultural heritage of the human race (Ward 1998). They were prized for their scarcity for centuries, and still remain a symbol of wealth and prestige to this day. The word diamond comes from the Greek adamas, meaning indestructible. Diamonds were ­ rst mined in India over 4000 years ago, but the modern diamond era only began in 1866, when huge diamond deposits were discovered in Kimberley, South Africa, creating a huge rush of European prospectors. The wealth this created helped to underwrite the British Empire, and changed the fates of many African countries. Apart from their appeal as gemstones, diamonds possess a remarkable range of physical properties. Indeed, a glance at any compendium of material data properties will prove that diamond is almost always`thealways`the biggest and best'. A selection of some of these properties is given in table 1. Among other properties, diamond is the hardest known material, has the highest thermal conductivity at room temperature , is transparent over a very wide wavelength range, is the sti¬est material, the least compressible, and is inert to most chemical reagents. With such a wide range of exceptional properties, it is not surprising that diamond has sometimes been referred to as`theas`the ultimate engineering material'. Unfortunately, it has proved very di¯ cult to exploit these properties, due both to the cost and scarcity of large natural diamonds, and the fact that diamond was only available in the form of stones or grit. It had been known for 200 years that diamond is composed solely of carbon (Tennant 1797), and many attempts were made to synthesize diamond arti­ cially using as a starting material another commonly occurring form of carbon, graphite. This proved extremely di¯ cult, mainly because at room temperature and pressure, graphite is the thermodynamically stable allotrope},

   abstract = { The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a promising quantum system for magnetometry applications exhibiting optical readout of minute energy shifts in its spin sub-levels. Key material requirements for NV ensembles are a high NV − concentration, a long spin coherence time and a stable charge state. However, these are interdependent and can be difficult to optimize during diamond growth and subsequent NV creation. In this work, we systematically investigate the NV center formation and properties in bulk chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond. The nitrogen flow during growth is varied by over four orders of magnitude, resulting in a broad range of single substitutional nitrogen concentrations of 0.2–20 parts per million. For a fixed nitrogen concentration, we optimize electron-irradiation fluences with two different accelerated electron energies, and we study defect formation via optical characterizations. We discuss a general approach to determine the optimal irradiation conditions, for which an enhanced NV concentration and an optimum of NV charge states can both be satisfied. We achieve spin–spin coherence times T 2 ranging from 45.5 to 549 μ s for CVD diamonds containing 168 to 1 parts per billion NV − centers, respectively. This study shows a pathway to engineer properties of NV-doped CVD diamonds for improved sensitivity. },

Among the possibilities in the solid state, a defect in diamond known as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV-1) center stands out for its robustness - its quantum state can be initialized, manipulated, and measured with high fidelity at room temperature. Here we describe how to systematically identify other deep center defects with similar quantum-mechanical properties. We present a list of physical criteria that these centers and their hosts should meet and explain how these requirements can be used in conjunction with electronic structure theory to intelligently sort through candidate defect systems. To illustrate these points in detail, we compare electronic structure calculations of the NV-1 center in diamond with those of several deep centers in 4H silicon carbide (SiC). We then discuss the proposed criteria for similar defects in other tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors.},

Depending upon the application required, the therapeutic compound being delivered, or the imaging agent being modified, certain nanoparticulate materials offer specific advantages that may uniquely enhance efficiency. Among the classes of particles being investigated, diamond-based platforms have emerged as promising vehicles for drug delivery and imaging following several recent studies that demonstrate their ability to enhance therapeutic efficacy, particularly for anthracyclines, mediate markedly improved magnetic resonance imaging contrast and photostable fluorescence, possess scalable processing parameters, and exhibit biocompatibility, among many other important attributes. More specifically, detonation NDs have faceted surfaces that can mediate potent interactions with surrounding water molecules or therapeutic compounds. This attribute can mitigate premature drug release to prevent major side effects such as myelosuppression, while water molecule recruitment can increase the relaxivity of covalently conjugated gadolinium. These properties of NDs and diamond-based devices will be discussed in this article, with a focus on therapeutic delivery in addition to insight on their use in imaging, devices, implants/coatings, and biocompatibility. Key areas of potential, where advances in biology and medicine can be realized through the continued development of this platform as well as requisite future studies, will also be highlighted.

For example, at a distance of 10 nm, the spin of a single electron produces a magnetic field of about 1 μT, and the corresponding field from a single proton is a few nanoteslas. A sensor able to detect such magnetic fields with nanometre spatial resolution would enable powerful applications, ranging from the detection of magnetic resonance signals from individual electron or nuclear spins in complex biological molecules to readout of classical or quantum bits of information encoded in an electron or nuclear spin memory. Here we experimentally demonstrate an approach to such nanoscale magnetic sensing, using coherent manipulation of an individual electronic spin qubit associated with a nitrogen-vacancy impurity in diamond at room temperature. Using an ultra-pure diamond sample, we achieve detection of 3 nT magnetic fields at kilohertz frequencies after 100 s of averaging.

   abstract = {Single substitutional nitrogen atoms N$_s^0$ are the prerequisite to create nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds. They serve as the electron donors to create the desired NV$^-$ center, provide charge stability against photo-ionisation, but also are the main source of decoherence. Therefore, precise and quick determination of N$_s^0$ concentration is a key advantage to a multitude of NV-related research in terms of material improvement as well as applications. Here we present a method to determine the N$_s^0$ concentration based on absorption spectroscopy in the UV-Visible range and fitting the 270 nm absorption band. UV-Visible spectroscopy has experimental simplicity and widespread availability that bear advantages over established methods. It allows a rapid determination of N$_s^0$ densities, even for large numbers of samples. Our method shows further advantages in determining low concentrations as well as the ability to measure locally, which is highly relevant for diamonds with largely varying N$_s^0$ concentrations in a single crystal. A cross-check with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) shows high reliability of our method and yields the absorption cross section of the 270~nm absorption band, $\sigma=1.96\pm0.15$ cm$^\{-1\}\cdot$ppm$^\{-1\}$ (in common logarithm) or $\sigma_e=4.51\pm0.35$ cm$^\{-1\}\cdot$ppm$^\{-1\}$ (in natural logarithm), which serves as a reference to determine N$_s^0$ concentrations, and makes our method applicable for others without the need for a known N$_s^0$-reference sample and calibration. We provide a rapid, practical and replicable pathway that is independent of the machine used and can be widely implemented as a standard characterization method for the determination of N$_s^0$ concentrations.},

Herein, we prepare ND nanothermometers coated with a nanogel shell and the photothermal agent indocyanine green serves as a heat generator and sensor. Upon irradiation, programmed cell death was induced in cancer cells with high spatial control. In parallel, the increase in local temperature was recorded by the ND nanothermometers. This approach represents a great step forward to record local temperature changes in different cellular environments inside cells and correlate these with thermal biology.},

   abstract = {Much progress has been made in recent years towards greater understanding of the various point and extended defects that give rise to colour in diamond and how such defects can be modified via treatment to change a diamond's colour. Such fundamental understanding has been vital in providing reliable means for gemmological laboratories to identify treated diamonds and ensure maintenance of consumer confidence in diamond. The application of high pressure high temperature treatment to remove a brown colour component has prompted significant research recently into the cause of brown colour. This article reviews progress to date and the evidence that indicates that clusters of around 60 vacancies are the defects responsible for the absorption causing brown colour. The general principles and techniques applied to the detection of diamonds subjected to high pressure high temperature treatment are also discussed. Detailed comparison between photoluminescence spectra from treated and untreated diamonds is vital in the identification of Type IIa diamonds, whilst absorption features provide a robust means of identification for Type I diamonds. A detection scheme based on the shape of the platelet-related infrared absorption is presented. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {High-purity type IIa diamond crystals of weight 1-2 carats, containing iess than 0.1 ppm chemical impurities and few incIusions, have been successfully synthesized by a temperature gradient method at high pressures and temperatures. The concentration of nitrogen impurities in the diamond crystals was reduced to less than 0.1 ppm by adding an element of the IVa group to the solvent as a nitrogen getter. The boron impurity concentration was reduced to less than 0.1 ppm by using a high-purity graphite (< 1 ppm impurities) as the carbon source. Nickel impurities were avoided by using an Fe-Co alloy system for the solvent. Furthermore, by adding elements which can reduce the formation of carbides such as TiC or ZrC in the solvent, inclusions of the carbide or the solvent metal in the diamond crystal were substantially decreased, and consequently good-quality type IIa diamond crystals were obtained even at a growth rate as high as 2-3 mg h-z.},
